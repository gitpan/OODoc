=head1 NAME

OODoc - object oriented production of code documentation


=head1 INHERITANCE

 OODoc
   is a OODoc::Object


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use OODoc;
 my $doc = OODoc->new(module => 'My Name', version => '0.02');
 $doc->processFiles(workdir => $dest);
 $doc->prepare;
 $doc->create('pod', workdir => $dest);
 $doc->create('html', workdir => '/tmp/html');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

OODoc stands for "Object Oriented Documentation".  The OO part refers
to two things: this module simplifies writing documentation for Object
Oriented programs, and at the same time, it is Object Oriented itself:
easily extensible.

OODoc is a rather new module, but is developed far enough to be
useful for most applications.  You have the possibility to modify
the output of the formatters to your taste using templates, although
it is not donfigurable in full extend.

Please contribute ideas.  Have a look at the main website of this
project at C<http://perl.overmeer.net/oodoc/>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

I<Error:> Cannot compile $parser class

The $parser class does not exist or produces compiler errors.

I<Error:> Parser $parser could not be instantiated

Something went wrong while starting the parser object.  Probably there is
an other error message which will tell you the exact cause.

I<Error:> cannot copy distribution file $fn to $dest: $!

For some reason, a plain file from can not be copied from your source
tree to the location where the distribution is made.

I<Error:> formatter $name has compilation errors: $@

The formatter which is specified does not compile, so can not be used.

I<Error:> manual definition requires manual object

A call to L<addManual()|"Manual Repository"> expects a new manual object (a L<OODoc::Manual|OODoc::Manual>),
however an incompatible thing was passed.  Usually, intended was a call
to L<manualsForPackage()|"Manual Repository"> or L<mainManual()|"Manual Repository">.

I<Warning:> no file $fn to include in the distribution

Probably your MANIFEST file lists this file which does not exist.  The file
will be skipped for now, but may cause problems later on.

I<Error:> no version specified for module "$name"

Version information will be added to all packages and all manual
pages.  You need to specify a version and be sure that it changes
with each release.

I<Error:> problems compiling $code for package $name: $@

Syntax error in your code, or a problem caused by stripping the file.
You can run your test-scripts before the files get stripped as long
as you do not use C<make test>, because that will try to produce
manual-pages as well...

I<Error:> requires a directory to write the distribution to

You have to give a value to C<workdir>.
When processing the manifest file, some files must be copied directly
to a temporary directory.  The packages are first stripped from
their pseudo doc, and then written to the same directory.  That
directory will be the place where C<make dist> is run later.

I<Error:> requires a directory to write the manuals to

You have to give a value to C<workdir>, which will be used as top directory
for the produced output.  It does not matter whether there is already some
stuff in that directory.

I<Error:> the produced module needs a descriptive name

Every module needs a name, which will be used on many places in the
documentation.

I<Error:> use regex, code reference or array for file selection

The L<processFiles(select)|"Parser"> option is not understood.  You may specify
an ARRAY, regular expression, or a code reference.


=head1 DETAILS


=head2 Why use OODoc in stead of POD

POD (Perl's standard Plain Old Document format) has a very simple
syntax.  POD is very simple to learn, and the produced manual pages
look like normal Unix manual pages.  However, when you start writing
larger programs, you start seeing the weaker sites of POD.

One of the main problems with POD is that is using a visual markup
style: you specify information by how it must be presented to the
viewer.  This in contrast with logical markup where you specify the
information more abstract, and a visual representation is created by
translation.  For instance in HTML defines a C<I > tag (visual markup
italic) and C<EM> (logical markup emphasis, which will usually show
as italic).

The main disadvantage of visual markup is lost information: the
formatter of the manual page can not help the author of the documentation
to produce more consistent manual pages.  This is not a problem for small
modules, but is much more needed when programs grow larger.

=head2 How does OODoc work

Like with POD, you simply mix your documentation with your code.  When
the module is distributed, this information is stripped from the files
by a I<parser>, and translated into an object tree.  This tree is then
optimized: items combined, reorganized, etc, to collect all information
required to produce useable manual pages.  Then, a I<formatter> is called
to generate the manual pages.

=head3 The parser

The parser reads the package files, and (by default) strip them from all
documentation.  The stripped files are written to a temporary directory
which is used to create the module distribution.

It is possible to use more than one parser for your documentation.  On
this moment, there is only one parser implemented: the Markov parser,
named after the author.  But you can add your own parser, if you want to. 
Within one module, different files can be parsed by different parsers.

The parser produces an object tree, which is a structured representation of
the documentation.  The tree is parser independent, and organized by
manual page.

=head3 Collecting relations

The second phase of the manual page generation process figures out the
relations between the manual pages.  It collects inheritance relations
and other organizational information which is to be used by the
manual page generators.

=head3 The formatter

The final phase can be called more than once: based on the same object
tree, documents can be produced in various formats.  The initial
implementation produces POD and HTML.

=head2 Getting Started

To use OODoc, you need to create a scripts which helps you producing
the distribution of your module.  The simpest script look like this:

 use OODoc;
 my $dist = '/tmp/abc';
 my $doc  = OODoc->new
  ( module     => 'E-mail handling'
  , version    => '0.01'
  );

 $doc->processFiles(workdir => $dist);  # parsing
 $doc->prepare;                         # collecting
 $doc->create('pod', workdir => $dist); # formatting to POD

The default parser will be used to process the files, see
L<OODoc::Parser::Markov|OODoc::Parser::Markov> for its syntax.  The formatter is
described in L<OODoc::Format::Pod|OODoc::Format::Pod>.

Once you have this working, you may decide to add options to the
calls to adapt the result more to your own taste.
