=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Error: Cannot read manifest file $filename: $!

The manifest file could not be opened for reading.

=item Warning: MANIFEST file $name lists filename outside (sub)directory: $file

The MANIFEST file of a distributed package should be located in the top
directory of that packages.  All files of the distribution are in that
same directory, or one of its sub-directories, otherwise they will not
be packaged.

=item Error: manual definition requires manual object

A call to L<addManual()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository"> expects a new manual object (a L<OODoc::Manual|OODoc::Manual>),
however an incompatible thing was passed.  Usually, intended was a call
to L<manualsForPackage()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository"> or L<mainManual()|OODoc::Object/"Manual Repository">.
